# About
TinyCBG is a lightweight library for reading a writing to Cybergrind files 
programatically. It's fast, intuitive, and easy to work with.

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute, please do! This is my first time 
making and publishing a proper crate, so some needed traits or documentation
may be missing. Open an issue before making signifant changes, but
for small things simply send a pull request. Thank you!
